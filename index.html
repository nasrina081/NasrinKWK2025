      <p>Welcome to my website!<br>
        I was born and raised in Philly and then moved to PG County, Maryland, in 2010. I have five siblings and I've had fish, a turtle, and a cat.
      </p>

      <p>I’m currently a rising senior at George Mason University and interning for my third summer at Microsoft as a Technical Product Manager intern. I’ve previously interned in software, design, and PM roles at Microsoft, Vytal Studios, and AT&T. I've built apps, led projects, and spoken at conferences along the way.</p>

      <p>I’m especially interested in product management, UX/UI, and intellectual property law. I love roles that combine creativity, strategy, and problem-solving.</p>

      <p>Outside of code, I’ve modeled, danced ballet since pre-K, led NSBE GMU as president, and helped students fall in love with learning through tutoring and outreach. I’ve also created content for brands like Samsung, Sol de Janeiro, and Hollister.</p>
