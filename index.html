    <h1>All About Nasrin Ali</h1>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I’m Nasrin — a computer science student, creative, and community advocate passionate about building tech that makes life better (and prettier). 👩🏽‍💻🎨</p>

      <p>I’m currently a rising senior at George Mason University and interning for my third summer at Microsoft as a Technical Product Manager intern. I’ve previously interned in software, design, and PM roles at Microsoft, Vytal Studios, and AT&T. I've built apps, led projects, and spoken at conferences along the way.</p>

      <p>I’m especially interested in product management, UX/UI, and intellectual property law. I love roles that combine creativity, strategy, and problem-solving.</p>

      <p>Outside of code, I’ve modeled, danced ballet since pre-K, led NSBE GMU as president, and helped students fall in love with learning through tutoring and outreach. I’ve also created content for brands like Samsung, Sol de Janeiro, and Hollister.</p>

      <p>Feel free to reach out here or email me at <a href="mailto:nasrinali081@gmail.com">nasrinali081@gmail.com</a> 💌</p>
