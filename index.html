              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Nasrin</strong> — a computer science student, creative, and community advocate passionate about building tech that makes life better (and prettier). 👩🏽‍💻🎨</p>

              <p>I’m currently a rising senior at <strong>George Mason University</strong> and interning for my third summer at <strong>Microsoft</strong> as a Technical Product Manager intern. I’ve previously interned in software, design, and PM roles at Microsoft, Vytal Studios, and AT&T. I've built apps, led projects, and spoken at conferences along the way.</p>

              <p>I’m especially interested in <strong>product management</strong>, <strong>UX/UI</strong>, and <strong>intellectual property law</strong>. I love roles that combine creativity, strategy, and problem-solving.</p>

              <p>Outside of code, I’ve modeled, danced ballet since pre-K, led <strong>NSBE GMU</strong> as president, and helped students fall in love with learning through tutoring and outreach. I’ve also created content for brands like <strong>Samsung</strong>, <strong>Sol de Janeiro</strong>, and <strong>Hollister</strong>.</p>
